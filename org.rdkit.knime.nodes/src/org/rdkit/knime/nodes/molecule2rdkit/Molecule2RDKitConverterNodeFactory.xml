    <name>Molecule to RDKit</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Generates RDKit molecules from a string representation (SDF or Smiles).
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Generates RDKit molecule column from a string representation 
        (SDF or Smiles) and appends it to the table.</intro>
        <option name="Molecule column">
            The column that contains the molecules (SDF or Smiles type column).
        </option>
        <option name="New column name">
            Name of the new column in the output table.
        </option>
        <option name="Remove source column">
            Toggles removal of the input molecule column in the output table.
        </option>        
        <option name="Error Handling">
            If the molecule in an input row cannot be converted, you can select
            if this row should be separated from the output table and be delivered 
            at the second port, or if a missing value should be inserted instead
            of the RDKit molecule in the result table.<br/><br/>
            Also, it is possible to get additional error information added
            for all structures that failed conversion. If this option is checked, 
            you need to specify the name of the error column.
        </option>
        <option name="Generate 2D Coordinates">
           Select this option to generate 2D coordinates for the molecules.
           The coordinates are used for, among other things, 2D renderings of the structures. 
           If not selected, the renderer will (re-)compute coordinates on 
           demand.
        </option>
        <option name="Force Generation">
           Select this box to enforce 2D coordinate generation. Coordinates may
           already be available in the (SDF) input, so this option allows you to
           discard the original coordinates and recompute from scratch.
        </option> 
        <option name="Advanced - Keep Hydrogens">
           Switch this option on to prevent the RDKit from removing hydrogens
       	   from molecules constructed from SDF. This option has no effect for SMILES or SMARTS input.
        </option>
        <option name="Advanced - Partial Sanitization">
           The RDKit does a fair amount of work when compounds are loaded to make sure that they are 
           chemically reasonable and correct. This is called sanitization. When switching on 
           partial sanitization the following options allow specific aspects of the sanitization to be turned off:
        </option>
        <option name="Advanced - Partial Sanitization Option - Reperceive Aromaticity">
           If enabled (the default) all molecules are converted to a Kekule form and then Hueckel's 
           rules are applied to determine aromaticity. If disabled, whatever aromaticity information 
           is present in the input will be used. NOTE: SDF/MOL data contains no information about aromaticity.
        </option>
        <option name="Advanced - Partial Sanitization Option - Correct Stereochemistry">
           If enabled (the default) all stereochemistry specifications will be checked to ensure that they 
           are not redundant or that stereochemistry markers are not set on either atoms or double bonds 
           that should not have them. 
        </option>
