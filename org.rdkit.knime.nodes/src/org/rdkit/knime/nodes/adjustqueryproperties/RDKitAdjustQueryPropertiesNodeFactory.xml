        Tunes query structures to get better search results.

        <intro>
        	Structure searches based on queries molecules are not always leading to the desired results. 
        	Often some fine tuning of the query structure helps to increase the search results. RDKit 
        	offers query properties that can be set explicitly for query molecules to influence a search. 
        	This node lets the user define the properties to be adjusted.

        <option name="RDKit Mol column">The input column with RDKit Query Molecules.</option>
        <option name="New column name">The name of the new column, which will contain the tunes queries as RDKit Molecules.</option>
        <option name="Remove source column">Set to true to remove the specified source column from the result table.</option>
        <option name="Adjust degree">Enable, so that modified atoms have an explicit-degree query added 
        	based on their degree in the query.</option>
        <option name="Adjust degree flag">Control, which atoms have a degree query added.</option>
        <option name="Adjust ring count">Enable, so that modified atoms have a ring-count query added 
        	based on their ring count in the query.</option>
        <option name="Adjust ring count flag">Control, which atoms have a ring-count query added.</option>
        <option name="Make dummies queries">Enable, so that dummy atoms that do not have a specified isotope 
        	are converted to any-atom queries.</option>
