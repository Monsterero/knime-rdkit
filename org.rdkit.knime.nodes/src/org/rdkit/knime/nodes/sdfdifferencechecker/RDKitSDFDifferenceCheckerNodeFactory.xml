        <intro>
        	Compares SDF strings of two columns and fails if differences are found. A tolerance range can be defined
        	for comparing floating point numbers. There is no "real" SDF logic in this node. It simply does the following:
        	First it removes all operating system specific characters and removes all white spaces that are found in a row 
        	replacing them by a single space. Then it walks through all remaining items which are now separated by single spaces and compares them.
        	If a numeric value is encountered that includes a floating point, it will try to parse it as a double number,
        	and if this succeeds for both sides, it will compare the numbers with each other. For the comparison
        	we can specify a tolerance.

        <option name="SDF column (table 2)">The second input column with SDF strings.</option>
        <option name="Tolerance for all floating point numbers">Every floating point number in the SDF string to be compared 
        	is allowed to have this tolerance range.</option>
        <option name="Fail on first encountered difference">Set to true to fail immediately when the first difference has been encountered.
        	Set to false to walk through the tables until the end to find more differences (console output) and then fail and
        	report the first encountered difference.</option>
